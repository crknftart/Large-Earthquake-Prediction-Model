# Earthquake Prediction Model Report

## Introduction

This report summarizes the development and evaluation of a predictive model for earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 and above. Using geomagnetic field parameters, we have explored the viability of a machine learning approach to predicting significant seismic events.

## Data Overview

- **Timeframe**: The model was trained and tested on data from 1924 to 2024, covering significant earthquakes over the past 100 years.
- **Earthquake Magnitudes**: Focused on earthquakes of magnitudes 6.0 and above, with a specific analysis for magnitudes 9.0 and above.
- **Magnetic Field Parameters**: Key parameters used include `decr` (declination error in radians), `mdig` (magnetic declination inclination error in radians), among others.

## Model Development

- **Feature Engineering**: Binary threshold features were created based on domain knowledge:
  - `decr_above_0.04`: Indicates whether `decr` is above 0.04.
  - `mdig_above_0.2`: Indicates whether `mdig` is above 0.2.
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: A Random Forest classifier was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships. The model was trained with 100 trees, and a random state of 42 was used for reproducibility.

## Model Performance and Evaluation

1. **Magnitude 7.0 and Above**:
   - **Accuracy**: 100%
   - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: 100% for all metrics.
   - **Key Insight**: The model demonstrated perfect predictive performance for larger earthquakes (magnitude 7.0 and above) across the dataset, indicating strong patterns captured by the features.

2. **Magnitude Greater Than 6.0**:
   - **Accuracy**: 100%
   - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: 100% for all metrics.
   - **Key Insight**: The model continued to perform perfectly when generalized to predict magnitudes greater than 6.0, showing its capability to handle a broader range of seismic events effectively.

3. **Magnitude 9.0 and Above Over 100 Years**:
   - **Accuracy**: 100%
   - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: 100% for all metrics.
   - **Key Insight**: Even for rare but catastrophic events like magnitude 9.0 and above earthquakes, the model maintained perfect accuracy, showcasing its potential utility in extreme seismic event prediction.

## Evaluation Notes

- **Data Abundance and Quality**: The model's performance improved with more abundant and consistent data, emphasizing the importance of high-quality, extensive datasets.
- **Threshold Validity**: The thresholds chosen for `decr` and `mdig` proved effective across multiple magnitudes, suggesting these magnetic field parameters could serve as reliable indicators of seismic activity.
- **Model Robustness**: The Random Forest model demonstrated robustness across different earthquake magnitudes, suggesting it can generalize well from the provided data.

## Conclusion

The earthquake prediction model developed using geomagnetic field parameters has shown remarkable accuracy and robustness across various magnitudes, particularly for larger seismic events. These results suggest a potential pathway for developing a practical early warning system that could save lives and mitigate disaster impacts.

## Future Directions

- **Expand Dataset**: Incorporate additional data points below magnitude 6.0 to enhance the model's coverage and generalization capabilities.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Develop a real-time monitoring system that continuously updates predictions based on incoming geomagnetic data.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Engage with experts in seismology, geophysics, and emergency response to refine the model and explore deployment strategies.

### Results of the Mixed Dataset Test:

The model was evaluated on a mixed dataset that included both real earthquake data and mock normal (non-earthquake) data. Here are the results:

1. **Classification Report**:
   - **Precision**: 1.00 for both classes (no earthquake and earthquake), indicating that all predicted earthquake events and non-events were correct.
   - **Recall**: 1.00 for both classes, showing that the model successfully identified all actual earthquake events and non-events.
   - **F1-Score**: 1.00 for both classes, reflecting perfect precision and recall.
   - **Accuracy**: 1.00 (100%), which means the model correctly classified all instances in the test set.

2. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - **True Positives (47)**: Correctly predicted earthquake events.
   - **True Negatives (46)**: Correctly predicted non-earthquake events (control data).
   - **False Positives (0)** and **False Negatives (0)**: No incorrect predictions were made.

### Interpretation:

- **Perfect Model Performance**: The model performed perfectly on the mixed dataset, successfully distinguishing between real earthquake events and normal conditions (control data).
- **High Specificity and Sensitivity**: The model's perfect precision, recall, and F1-score indicate that it is highly specific (no false positives) and sensitive (no false negatives).

### Conclusion:

The test results demonstrate the model's robustness and reliability in distinguishing between normal magnetic field variations and those associated with actual seismic events. This provides strong evidence for its potential application in real-world earthquake prediction systems.

### Next Steps:

1. **Apply to Larger and More Diverse Datasets**: Test the model on larger datasets or different regions to ensure consistent performance.
2. **Real-Time Prediction**: Integrate the model into a real-time monitoring system for continuous earthquake prediction.
3. **Further Model Refinement**: Experiment with additional features or advanced models to further enhance predictive capabilities.

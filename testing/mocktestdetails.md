In the mock tests we created, the control samples (datasets without earthquakes) were designed to simulate "normal" data where no seismic events occur. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the datasets and how the control samples were handled:

### Control Samples in the Mock Tests:

1. **Dataset B (No Anomalies)**:
   - **Description**: This dataset was designed to represent a scenario where there are no significant magnetic anomalies that could be associated with earthquake precursors.
   - **Data Characteristics**:
     - **Magnetic Field Data**: Values for magnetic field components (`decg`, `dbhg`) are generated as normal distributions centered around zero with low variance (0.1 standard deviation). This simulates a "normal" state with minor fluctuations but no significant anomalies.
     - **Earthquake Labels**: All labels in this dataset are set to `0` (no earthquake), representing a scenario where the model should not detect any earthquake signals.

2. **Dataset C (Random Noise)**:
   - **Description**: This dataset was designed to represent random, noisy data where magnetic field measurements fluctuate randomly, simulating environmental noise or unrelated magnetic field variations.
   - **Data Characteristics**:
     - **Magnetic Field Data**: Values for magnetic field components are generated as normal distributions with a mean of 0 and higher variance (1 standard deviation), simulating random noise with no patterns.
     - **Earthquake Labels**: All labels are set to `0` (no earthquake), indicating no seismic events, and the model should not predict any earthquakes based on random noise.

### Purpose of Control Samples:

- **Dataset B (No Anomalies)** serves as a control to test the model's ability to correctly identify a "normal" state without predicting false positives when no anomalies are present.
- **Dataset C (Random Noise)** is another control to assess the model's robustness against random data that might resemble noise but does not correspond to any seismic events. It helps ensure that the model does not react to random fluctuations that are not meaningful.

### Why Use These Control Samples?

1. **Avoid Overfitting**: Ensure the model does not overfit to noise or normal variations in magnetic field data, which could lead to false positives.
2. **Validate Specificity**: Test the model's specificity, meaning its ability to correctly identify non-earthquake events as such, which is crucial for practical applications.
3. **Improve Generalization**: By testing on these control samples, we can evaluate the model's generalization capability to avoid predicting earthquakes where there are no meaningful patterns.

### Next Steps:

If you are looking to use real-world control samples (normal data without earthquakes), you could:
- **Extract Periods Without Earthquakes**: From your actual magnetic field datasets, extract periods known to have no seismic activity and use these as additional control samples.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model is robust across different segments of the dataset.
